//Sliding Window problems are problems in which a fixed or variable-size window is moved through a data structure, 
//typically an array or string, to solve problems efficiently based on continuous subsets of elements. 
//This technique is used when we need to find subarrays or substrings according to a given set of conditions.

//These problems generally require Finding Maximum/Minimum Subarray, Substrings which satisfy some specific condition.
